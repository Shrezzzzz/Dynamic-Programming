# Dynamic-Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid redundant computations. 
Matrix Chain Multiplication finds the optimal way to parenthesize matrices for minimum multiplication cost. 
Job Scheduling optimizes task execution to maximize profit while considering constraints. 0/1 Knapsack determines the maximum value that can be obtained within a weight limit. 
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences, making it useful in text similarity and bioinformatics.
